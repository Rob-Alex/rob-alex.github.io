My name is Robbie Alexander, I am currently pursuing a PhD in EEE with a focus on high voltage generation, computational modelling, pulsed power and electric propulsion systems. My research can be found in my [University Profile](https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/persons/robbie-alexander).

This is my blog is for documenting my personal projects and interests. Most of my projects will be related to electrical engineering, however sometimes I might also write about mathematics, science and programming!
